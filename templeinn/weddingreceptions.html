            <h1>Temple Inn & Suites Reception Hall</h1>
            <p>At Temple Inn & Suites, we know that it can be difficult to find a venue for a wedding reception that is in a convenient location. This is why we have a full-service reception hall  located at each one of our hotels. We offer venue services, catering services, and setup services as well. Each reception can be tailored to meet your exact wants and needs.
