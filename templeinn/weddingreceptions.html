            <h1>Temple View Inn & Suites Reception Hall</h1>
            <p>At Temple View Inn & Suites, we know that it can be difficult to find a venue for a wedding reception that is in a convenient location. This is why we have a full-service reception hall located at each one of our hotels. We offer venue services, catering services, and setup services as well. Each reception can be tailored to meet your exact wants and needs.

                <p>Our event staff can handle as much or as little of the background work as you would like. They can handle all of the setup and takedown work while you man the kitchen, they can take care of everything, or they can just be there to help clean up at the end of the night.</p>
