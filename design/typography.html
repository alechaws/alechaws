        <p>Typography encompasses all of the aspects of a typeface. The font that a developer or a company chooses to use for their site has a large  impact on the usability of the site. If the font of a website is difficult to read, then the website is inherently difficult to use as well.</p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.logitech.com">Logitech</a> has a very nice example of a well picked typeface. Throughout their entire website, they use a few standard fonts- including a few that are proprietatry to their brand. All of the fonts that they utilize are sharp and easy to read. This makes the website a pleasure to usea, as you are not struggling to read what the page is trying to convey. This makes the user experience top notch.</p>
