        <p>Proximity deals with the spacing of items on a webpage as well as the space that does not have anything (commonly referred to as white space). The placement of objects and blocks of text is crucial to having a well designed web page. If the balance is done correctly, then the aspects of a page look like they beling together and attention can be directed to the apppropriate portion of the page. If proximity is off, then a page can feel too empty or cluttered.</p>

        <p>The page that I chose to be an example of good use of proximity, as well as of white space, is <a href="https://www.everydollar.com">Everydollar.com.</a> This website is a budgeting site that sports a clean design. On any given page, the number of emelemts on the page is kept down to the essentials to avvoid the pages feling cluttered. On many of the pages, there are whole sections that are left blank intentonally too. These blank spaces force your attention to the properareas of the site, and also add to the minimalist design the the site has.</p>
